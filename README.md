Problem statement :- 
  Inappropriate diagnosis in hospitals and clinics leads to any mishaps.
  This generally happens due to broad channel between doctors and patients, which makes the patients vulnerable to 
  whatever the doctor prescribes, not knowing it properly.
  
  To create a transparent medium for the patient in order to avail a correct diagnosis.
  In order to tackle the situation, we designed a way through which a patient can have access to the best 
  diagnosis available in the vicinity. 
SOLUTION :- 
  For this, we created a sample database using MYSQL which will store the various details which includes medicine name 
  corresponding to a particular disease, trustworthy company, price, dosage.
How it will work :- 
  A person arrives at the medicine store with a list of medicines.
  The chemist enters the data mentioned in the prescription into the programme along with name of the patient.
  The programme checks the authenticity of the product mentioned in the prescription.
  In order to check the authenticity, a comparision is drawn between the entered product and the predefined product.
  Once the authenticity is done, the final amount is printed, if not then corresponding warning message is shown.
